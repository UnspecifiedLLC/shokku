# Contributing

Contributions to this project are very **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

You're encouraged to question everything about the project but, please, do it with respect and good manners (see our [Code of Contuct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information).

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/ubiq/shokku).

## Pull Requests

- **Coding Standards**: Make sure ESLint doesn't throw any errors. We pretty much follow [what Airbnb says](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with a couple of exceptions.
- **Create feature branches**: It's important to be concise with your commits, so don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **Add tests if applicable**: Your patch probably won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests (but will depend on the situation).
- **Document any change in behaviour**: Make sure the `README.md`, Postman files and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle**: We follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
- **One pull request per feature**: If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history**: Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

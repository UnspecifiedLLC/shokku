**Note**: Until further notice, this project is in heavy development mode (don't expect everything to work out of the box, also the documentation is lacking and many more)!

## Description

Shokku provides you with a complete way of having your own infrastructure for Ubiq and Ethereum (soon) nodes (pretty much like Infura does), exposing them with a nice JSON API, allowing you to have full control on the whole process.

If you want, you can try the live service hosted in [https://api.shokku.com](https://api.shokku.com) (to be deployed soon).

## Motivation

If you're asking why the existence of this project, I recommend you to read [this Medium article](https://medium.com/) (to be released soon) where I explain the reasoning in more detail.

## Development Setup

Please see [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information.

## Deployment

Please see [DEPLOYMENT](DEPLOYMENT.md) for more details and options.

## TODO

Towards releasing version 1.0.0, there are several tasks that need attention. We're using Github Issues to track everything, with a sweet flavor of Waffle to have a better overall overview.

A couple of tasks that would be awesome to have help would be:

- [ ] Configure services like travis, waffle...
- [ ] Finish properly tests and make lint happy
- [ ] Finish Docker [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com/) provisioner.
- [ ] Finish Docker [Vultr](http://vultr.com/) provisioner.
- [ ] Provide a better way to backup blockchain data (in case of Gubiq instances) to spin up quickly more instances without downloading the whole blockchain.
- [ ] Create [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) provisioner for setting up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster tailored for Shokku.
- [ ] Create a set of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) recipes for spining Shokku inside a Kubernetes cluster.
- [ ] Add support to Ethereum nodes. Improve API to allow having Ubiq and Ethereum options (or to spin one or another depending on needs).
- [ ] Add complete support to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) nodes.
- [ ] Add rate limiting usage to the API.
- [ ] Add permissions to use the API with proper JWT sessions (have a better control access).
- [ ] Improve session API stickiness with [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) (at least for Docker Swarm).
- [ ] Prepare the code to scale and support heavy load.
- [ ] Increase code coverage.
